# Cleaning up Japan data for analysis
#
# Phenology codes:
# FFD: First flowering date
# FHD: First heard date (the date an insect or bird was first heard)
# FOD: First observation date (the date an insect or bird was first seen)
# LCD: Leaf coloring date
# LDD: Leaf drop date
# PFD: Peak flowering date
# FGD: *** uncertain. First gudding date. wtf is that
#
# Outcomes:
#
# Got rid of first column, which was just redundant sp./event code
# Formatted into columns: station, year, species, stage, phenology, DOY
# Assuming the phenology dates are represented as "MMDD". Need to check on this
# Also assuming that "0" phenology dates are actually "NA" ÃŸ
# I need to figure out what the "event" codes mean
#
# Some phenphases are in the winter, and dates are reported straddling then new year but without the year specifies.
# To deal with this, I'm just keeping the year as stated and converting pre-January dates into negative DOYs when there is evidence of split
