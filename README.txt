This repository contains data and code to reproduce the analysis, generate figures, and generate tables for "Disorder or a new order: how climate change affects phenology and its variability" (Stemkovski et al., in prep). To reproduce everything, download these folders and files, open an R session, set your working directory to this location, and execute the backbone script titled "run_everything.R". Make sure to have all of the packages installed that are loaded at the top of the "run_everything.R" script.

A pre-print of the study can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.463688v1

Folder descriptions:

scripts: R-scripts used in the data cleaning, analysis, and figure generation.

raw_data: Data acquired directly from data collaborators and data download portals. There are also several taxonomy data files which I (Michael Stemkovski) looked up manually to aid with trait data assimilation.
* The "terraclimate" subdirectory is empty because the data is too large to upload to github. To download this data, follow the instructions at http://www.climatologylab.org/wget-terraclimate.html to get "tmax" data for all years. To obtain access to the raw data files, contact me at m.stemkovski@gmail.com.

clean_data: Data which has been cleaned with the scripts in the "scripts" folder.

figures: Figures generated by the scripts.

manuscript: Tables will be generated and saved into this folder.
